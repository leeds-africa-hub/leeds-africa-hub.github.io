    <p>
        The Leeds-Africa Conference on Data Science and AI in Mathematical and Physical Sciences is a venue for 
        sharing research insights across areas of science that are being transformed by developments in Artificial Intelligence, 
        Machine learning and Data Science. We seek to bring together from the UK and across Africa to build new partnerships and 
        collaborations, giving researchers the opportunity to share their research with new communities and discover new applications
        for theoretical developments in mathematical and computational methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        Areas of interest include Agriculture, Astronomy, Bioinformatics, Climate Science, Ecology, Financial Mathematics, Fluid Mechanics as well as advances in Computer Science and Mathematics.
        As well as these topics, we are keen to invite interest in other application areas - please let us know if you would like to present your research in other fields!
    </p>
    <p>
        To apply to attend the conference, please complete <a href="./registration/index.html">the application form</a>. We have funds to support attendees who would otherwise be unable to attend because of financial constraints.
        Please indicate on your application if you require financial assistance, and if possible an estimate of your travel costs to Pretoria. If you have any questions about the conference or 
        would like to discuss your application, please contact the organisers.
